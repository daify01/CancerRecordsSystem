# CancerRecordsSystem
A project (in progress), to help hospitals properly manage records for breast cancer patients. This is essential in countries where there are no proper records for breast cancer, and therefore societal progress against the disease cannot be measured.

This application was developed using Asp.Net(C#). It uses Nhibernate for the ORM, C# for the backend, ASP.Net, HTML5, jquery and javascript. JQuery Select 2 and JQuery chosen frameworks were used for the interactive list displays
